# Job Command Center — project guide

A personal **job-discovery inbox + application tracker**. Next.js (App Router) on
Vercel, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS). Built multi-user from day one (single
owner for now) — every row is scoped by `user_id` and enforced with RLS. Each
morning it ingests roles from public job APIs + ATS boards, AI-scores them against
your profile/CV, and ranks the inbox best-fit-first.

## Documentation (`docs/`)

Start at [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) (the index). Deep dives, all reconciled
to the code:

| Doc | Covers |
| --- | ------ |
| [`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md) | env vars, migrations, auth, deploy, cron — run it locally + on Vercel. |
| [`docs/code-structure.md`](docs/code-structure.md) | layers, the Supabase clients, where code lives, request flows. |
| [`docs/database.md`](docs/database.md) | every table/column/RLS/index/trigger + ER diagram (14 tables). |
| [`docs/ai-scoring.md`](docs/ai-scoring.md) | the fit-scoring pipeline: prompts, batching, caching, encrypted key, `scoring_runs`, cron. |
| [`docs/logging.md`](docs/logging.md) | `activity_events` (human feed) vs `ingestion_runs` (ops) + `/activity`. |
| [`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md) | the HUD language: tokens, `HudFrame`, dials, board/console. |
| [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) | the Vitest suite (19 files / 227 tests) + the manual walkthrough. |
| [`docs/cowork-import.md`](docs/cowork-import.md) | the on-demand `/api/import` recipe. |

## Stack / conventions

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, TypeScript strict, Turbopack). Note the v16 changes:
  - The old `middleware.ts` convention is **`proxy.ts`** (named export `proxy`,
    nodejs runtime). Ours lives at the repo root and refreshes the Supabase session.
  - `cookies()` / `headers()` are **async**. `params` / `searchParams` are Promises.
- **Tailwind v4** — design tokens live in `src/app/globals.css` under `@theme`
  (no `tailwind.config.js`). Dark "command-center" palette; one amber accent
  (`--color-accent`) reserved for the primary action + "needs action" signal.
- **Supabase auth** via `@supabase/ssr` (never the deprecated `auth-helpers`).
  Three clients in `src/lib/supabase/`: `client.ts` (browser), `server.ts`
  (RSC/actions/route handlers), `proxy.ts` (`updateSession` for the root proxy).
  Magic-link by default (`/auth/callback` PKCE), Google OAuth optional,
  `/auth/confirm` for the token_hash flow.

```

SEO / icons / social: file-based Next metadata only (no manual `<head>`). The
root `layout.tsx` sets `metadataBase` (the prod URL), a title template, the
shared description, and base `openGraph`/`twitter` (images come from the
`opengraph-image`/`twitter-image` conventions — don't also list them in the
metadata object or you get duplicate tags); `themeColor`/`colorScheme` live in a
separate `viewport` export. `/` and `/demo` set their own title/description —
nested `openGraph`/`twitter` REPLACE (not deep-merge) the parent, so re-include
`type`/`siteName`/`locale`/`card` there. All icons derive from `app/icon.svg`
via `npm run icons` (outputs committed; the 192/512/maskable PNGs live in
`/public` for the manifest).

Perceived performance: route segments stream — the shell paints immediately,
slow data (the discovery job list, the activity feed) is wrapped in `<Suspense>`
with a HUD skeleton, and each segment has a `loading.tsx` (route skeleton) +
`error.tsx` (the shared `HudError` boundary, retry-able). Skeleton primitives
live in `components/hud-skeleton.tsx` (the `hud-skeleton` shimmer in
`globals.css` is disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`). Mutations are
optimistic via `useOptimistic`/`useTransition` (source toggle, job state,
clear-action). The **tracker board** (`tracker-board.tsx`, client) is a
**@dnd-kit** kanban: lanes are droppables (id = status), `board-card.tsx` cards
are draggables (grip handle carries pointer/touch/keyboard listeners). A
cross-column drop optimistically moves the card and calls `setStatus` (rolls
back on error); Rejected/Closed are compact archive drop zones so the full
lifecycle is drag-reachable. `DragOverlay` previews the card; reduced-motion
kills the drop animation. Status filter applies in console view only (the board
needs every lane populated). The discovery inbox is **DB-paginated** (`actions/discovery.ts`
`loadJobsPage`, range/limit) with IntersectionObserver infinite scroll, and the
`DiscoveryList` client component owns the list state so AI scoring streams **per
job** (`actions/scoring.ts` `scoreOneJob` returns the fit fields; the client
runs them with bounded concurrency and updates each badge as it returns).

Activity + ingestion logs: every mutating Server Action emits exactly one
`activity_events` row via `logActivity` (the single emission point) — a
denormalized `summary` string is stored for trivial rendering, built by the pure
`buildActivitySummary(type, meta)`. The TELEMETRY strip (/needs-action) and the
full `/activity` feed read this table. Ingestion runs (manual-all, per-source,
cron) additionally write structured `ingestion_runs` + `ingestion_run_sources`
rows and emit one `ingestion.completed` event; counts distinguish **fetched vs
new vs updated** (`persistJobs` diffs existing keys before the upsert — never
label fetched as upserted). Secrets are REDACTED from stored run messages. The
one deliberate exception to one-event-per-mutation: **message-template** CRUD
(`actions/templates.ts`) emits NO event — templates are settings, not activity.

Profile + CV: `profiles` is one row per user (PK `user_id`). CV text lands in
`cv_text` two ways — pasted, or extracted from a PDF uploaded to the private
`cvs` Storage bucket (RLS per-user folder) using `unpdf` (serverless PDF.js, no
native binaries). Both paths go through Server Actions in `actions/profile.ts`.

AI (fit-scoring + CV prefill + message drafting): uses the **Anthropic API** via the official
`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, **server-only**, on **Claude Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5`
— fast/cheap, no `effort` param). `src/lib/ai` splits into a **pure core**
(`prompt.ts`, `parse.ts` (zod), `hash.ts`, `score.ts` — unit-tested via an
injected `ModelCall` seam, like `fetchImpl`) and **server-only** glue (`client.ts`
SDK wrapper, `crypto.ts` aes-256-gcm, `resolve-key.ts`). Each user stores their
**own** Anthropic key (encrypted in `user_secrets` with `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`);
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is the owner/demo fallback. No key → scoring is disabled with
a message, never a crash. `jobs.scored_profile_hash` makes scores re-stale when
the profile changes. **Keep `src/lib/ai` server-only modules out of the test
import graph** — `server-only` throws under vitest.

Message templates (reusable outreach boilerplate, Phase 4): `message_templates`
rows carry a `body`/`subject` with `{company}/{role}/{contact}/{stack}/{name}`
slots. Pure `src/lib/templates.ts` (`fillTemplate` substitutes known tokens,
leaves unknown/empty ones literal; `buildTemplatePayload`/`validateTemplate`) is
unit-tested. The `draftMessage` action (`actions/templates.ts`) fills the slots
from the contact/company/profile context (always available, no key) and — when
`ai:true` — personalizes the filled draft with `runDraft` (the same `ModelCall`
seam; pure `buildDraftPrompt`/`parseDraftResponse`), degrading with
`NO_KEY_MESSAGE` if no key. It returns the draft only; it never auto-sends or
auto-logs. Templates are managed on **/profile** and used from the **outreach
composer** on /contacts (pick → fill → optional ✦ AI → Log outreach).

Batched + cached + async scoring (the inbox can hold hundreds of jobs):
`buildBatchScorePrompt` scores up to `BATCH_SCORE_CAP` (8) jobs in ONE request,
with the system prompt + profile/CV in a `cache_control: ephemeral` prefix reused
across a run's chunks (Haiku min cacheable prefix is 4096 tokens — a no-op below
that). `parseBatchScoreResponse` (zod) maps results back by `job_id` and tolerates
missing/extra/duplicate entries — it never throws, so one bad chunk can't sink the
batch. Runs are DB-tracked + resumable in `scoring_runs` (status
queued/running/done/error/cancelled; total/completed/failed): `startScoring`
creates a 'running' run (cap `SCORING_MANUAL_CAP`=100) and returns the id without
blocking; the Discovery client drives `/api/scoring/chunk` until `remaining=0`,
filling each card's badge from the chunk's `updated` and showing "scored X / N"
(with Cancel, and Resume offered on load for an unfinished run). The daily cron
also auto-scores newly-ingested jobs (`trigger='cron'`, cap `SCORING_CRON_CAP`,
wall-clock-bounded). Pure batch logic lives in `prompt.ts`/`parse.ts`/`score.ts`/
`progress.ts` (unit-tested via the `ModelCall` seam); the DB+SDK glue is
server-only `scoring-run.ts` (`createScoringRun`/`processChunk`/
`runScoringToCompletion`).

## Working rules (for future changes)

- **Verify before integrating a source.** Training data may be stale — web-search
  the current endpoint + terms before touching a source fetcher. Legitimate APIs,
  public ATS endpoints, and Cowork-on-demand import only. **No headless scrapers,
  no LinkedIn/Indeed scraping, no bypassing auth/anti-bot/CAPTCHAs.**
- **Keep the pure logic tested.** `normalize`, `dedupe`, and `filters` are pure and
  must stay covered. Run `npm test` after touching them.
- **Green gate before "done":** `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build && npm test`.
- Small, scoped commits. Update this file when structure changes.
